        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
Dear self,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you open this letter, I hope it brings back the memory of the ethics class you took senior year. I am writing to you to remind you of some of the most valuable lessons and concepts you’ve learned in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lesson I want to bring back to you is the role of money. You might already be pursuing a lucrative career right now, eager to work harder and earn more. And admittedly, people associate their career goals closely with different levels of salaries, so you might as well be measuring your success based on promotions, increase in pay, or bonuses. However, when setting goals for your career and later points of your life, it is extremely important to consider factors other than money. Though it may sound too simple, money isn’t everything. In fact, you do not even need that much money to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you have always cared about money. At Penn, one of the reasons you rarely skipped a class was the mental calculation for how much tuition it’s worth. You thought that with enough money, you would be able to do anything you want, for example starting your own animation studio. It was your belief that the more you earn, the happier you would be. However, in your ethics class, you realized money is not as powerful as you had thought; it actually had lots of limitations. Many things simply cannot be purchased with money, which included some of the most important things in our lives – freedom, health, love and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, you should think about what matters to you besides money starting now. When choosing your first job after graduation, did you give up a work that interested you more but offered less salary? Have you ever made unethical decisions driven by profits just like what Elizabeth Holmes did? You need to be aware that when money becomes the biggest factor in decision-making in business, people at organizations sometimes choose their action not because it is the most rightful thing to do, but because doing so would generate the highest gain or involve the lowest cost. The extremely detrimental outcome of such decisions was clearly illustrated by the Ford Pinto case. Therefore, it is crucial to always know the moral limits of markets despite the lure of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson I want to emphasize is the five theories of moral reasoning. Specifically, I believe that the virtue theory will apply most to the business you are in. “Business must be conceived as an essential part of the good and virtuous life.” The day you learned about this theory, you realized you are a firm believer of it. Since you are a highly compassionate and empathetic individual, you know that you want to do things that will bring value to the society. For two years, you served as an active member of the Alpha Phi Omega service-based organization and participated in various kinds of service projects. Therefore, when choosing an industry or company, it is also important to make sure their values and business moral compass align with your own. Google, the company you interned at, had an unofficial motto “don’t be evil”. When it removed the line from its code of conduct in May 2018, other Googlers questioned about the decision as they cared deeply about the code of conduct aligning with their personal values just like you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your find that your firm’s business conduct does not align with your personal values, you will face the decision between “exit, voice, and loyalty.” If that happens, I hope that you consider voice as your first choice. Voice your concerns to your managers and explain to them your moral reasoning. For example, if you work as a software engineer and just find a bug in the newest version of an App to be launched the next day, you should talk to the technical managers and suggest delaying the release date, since the bug will negatively influence the user experience or even cause large profit loss for your clients. If you voice would not be heard, then it’s totally fine to exit, just like Greg Smith’s decision to leave Goldman Sachs when he realized the firm no longer attempts the best thing for its clients but started to focus on profits instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last message I wish to deliver is to ask constantly, “how will I measure my life?” Specifically, out of the three sub-questions, “How can I be sure to stay out of jail and live a life of integrity?” The key is to consciously avoid the “marginal cost” mistake. You need to define what you stand for and draw the line. In the past, you might have made this mistake several times, such as eating a bag of chip during a diet. Although those were minor issues, the “just this once” line of thought will eventually sucker you in and lead you down the wrong path, with much more severe consequences and no turning back. It is surprising how many people have been sentenced to jail for committing insider trading. Similar to you, they were highly-intellectual people with elite educational background, yet their failure to resist temptation had led to the cascade of consequences which they eventually bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I conclude this letter, I hope the three lessons discussed here will remain with you in the long haul. I chose them because they were the most relatable and would have the greatest impact on your career and your life as a whole. Your business will span the majority part of your life, so I hope you will always keep your moral compass calibrated so it will guide you the right way. In the end, my biggest wish for you is to be happy, so that you will always be able to get a good night of sleep for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflection on Love and Relationship from “Isle of Dogs”]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Isle of Dogs” was a gem I discovered on my 16-hour flight back to China after my summer internship.

&lt;p&gt;“Isle of Dogs” was a gem I discovered on my 16-hour flight back to China after my summer internship. In this latest movie, Wes Anderson creates a world that seems remotely connected to ours while being uniquely absurd. The fictional Japanese city Megasaki is similarly civilized but is ruled by a cat-fancying tyrannical mayor. Dogs are banished from the human society to the isolated place of Trash Island. As a result, the effect is both thrilling and terrifying. Although I have never owned a dog myself, I personally found myself asking plaintively throughout the movie, “what happened to man’s best friend?”. The movie successfully arouses our love and sympathy towards the dogs, whom are indeed rescued in the end. However, the relationship between the dogs and human characters has made me ponder what might be the true component of such strong emotional bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is narrated from the perspective of the dogs, who also provide the emotions in this movie. The five main dogs living on Trash Islands are Rex, Duke, Boss, King, and Chief. They are pleasant, intelligent, and has learned to be independent from the unreliable kindness of mans. However, deep down their hearts they are still longing for their past connections with their masters, and they yearn for a gentle pat on the head - except Chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief is different from the other dogs since the beginning. He is the strongest and the most rebellious. He would always disagree with the opinions of others, and from his past experience he refuses to become a pet again. However, when the boy Atari arrives on the island and starts the journey to find his “Spots”, Chief accompanies him, and develops emotional connection to the boy as the story progresses. When Atari and Chief find Spots to realize that he has already formed a family, Chief chooses to stay with Atari and becomes his new bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the reason that leads to Chief’s drastic change in attitude is responsibility. He serves as Atari’s guardian along the journey, protecting him from being harmed. When Atari asks him to fetch a stick, he does, after refusing twice, saying “I’m not doing this because you commanded me to; I’m doing this because I feel sorry for you.” Chief could have left Atari straight, but he knows if he abandons him, Atari would never walk out of Trash Island alive let alone find Spots. After Chief fetches the stick, Atari pours his love into Chief. He gives Chief a bath and shares half of Spots’ biscuit with Chief. It is at this moment that Chief, who has always fought for his own freedom and honor, realizes what it feels to be loved and relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Chief and Atari, I realize that for them, and for every relationship, the love, loyalty, or trust requires effort. It does not contain true independence nor freedom, but requires responsibilities and compromises. When Chief leaves his former master and lives the life of a stray dog, he also eliminates the possibility of being loved. However, when Chief realizes how important he is to Atari and that responsibility somehow means love, he is willing to put down his guard and pride and open to a new life. His new master Atari risks his life for dogs, tries to rescue them, and firmly believes in them. As Chief learns about the relationship between love, self-esteem and responsibility, he is able to grow, and feels the joy of being loved again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Little Prince, the fox says, “to me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys… To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.” Just like the little prince and the fox, Atari tamed Chief, and they both become the unique to each other. At the same time, however, love isn’t all about being tamed. When Atari finds his beloved Spots, Spots has formed a family and begun another life. Although they still care deeply about each other, their relationship as bodyguard and master has ended. Yet even when there is no more responsibility to be assumed and no more accompany to be kept, their emotional connection remains tight. Therefore, we see that love is also about letting go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beautiful Isle of Dogs, we learn through a dog’s eyes the love, hate, and the complicated relationship between man and dog. The dogs in the movie are not humans’ subordinates but their equal. Although the movie contains other implications of political and cultural issue, we can learn from the characters that a true bond often finds its roots in mutual understanding, making concessions and most importantly being responsible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflection on Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since I was little, I have always thought that Mickey Mouse was a first-of-its-kind cartoon character: an energetic, witty animal figure…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-london.netlify.com/lucky-rabbit/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-london.netlify.com/lucky-rabbit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

          /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
Since I was little, I have always thought that Mickey Mouse was a first-of-its-kind cartoon character: an energetic, witty animal figure with unique characteristics, who makes his daily life full of adventure. I never knew that Mickey actually had a “brother”. Thus, it was very surprising for me to find out the existence of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. After watching “Trolley Troubles”, I came to believe that Oswald was just as important and influential as Mickey. Audience should not forget Oswald, but rather give him more recognition, for the great influence he has had on Disney’s most famous character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trolley Troubles (1927)” was an animated short in which Oswald made his debut on silver-screen. It did a great job in storytelling as well as portraying the main character. Compared to the other animation I watched from this period, the short really captured my attention: unlike the other characters who seemed to have no personality, Oswald fully spiked my interest with his characteristics. As the owner of a trolley car, he turned the trip into a wild ride. Numerous obstacles had blocked his way in the film, yet he was able to come up with various witty solutions to get the trolley moving again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching Mickey’s “Steamboat Willie (1928)” for comparison, I found that Oswald and Mickey not only had similar appearance, but also shared the same personality traits. Both of them had wide white eyes, square pants and big black ears. And personality wise, Oswald was energetic, optimistic and venturesome. Just like Mickey, he loved to play and made other characters laugh. They both had some minor flaws, which made them more realistic as characters. For example, Oswald seemed somehow careless with his passengers, while Mickey was wacky violent with the animals in Steamboat Willie. Yet despite these flaws, they still had morals and tried to do the right thing throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The striking similarities between Oswald and Mickey clearly shows the influence Oswald has had on Mickey, given the fact that Mickey came out after Oswald was snatched away from Mr. Walt Disney. I was sad finding out that the image and characteristics of Oswald were changed significantly after his distributor Charles Mintz took over the rights to the series. According to Becky Cline, the director of the Walt Disney Archives, “Oswald was kind of a rogue. He was a lothario.” Mickey, on the other hand, “is more of a gentleman than Oswald was. ” However, in my opinion such an Oswald figure was definitely not whom his creator Walt Disney had intended him to be. I believe Walt Disney would have portrayed Oswald the same way as he did Mickey, had Oswald not been stolen from him. Mickey’s characteristics illustrate an ideal image of the original Oswald, and Oswald would otherwise have remained his original mischievous yet well-meaning identity which made him so popular among cartoons in the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other video: “Epic Mickey: the History of Oswald (2012)” really touched my heart. In my opinion, the game Epic Mickey served as a great Catharsis for the tragedy of Oswald. Osward made his first comeback in the game, and ruled the world “Wasteland” which was for forgotten Disney characters including himself. As the first forgotten character in Disney history, he fashioned it after Disneyland, except that he put images of himself instead of Mickey everywhere. It really hit me when I read that Oswald disliked Mickey for taking over his popularity that he felt like he deserved. The plot was a big emotional touchdown, just like the director described, that both Mickey and Oswald were able to reconcile, found out they had family that they had forgotten, and became like true brothers. By ending this way, the game offered a chance of “redemption”, reminding audience of the one incredible character they had forgotten, and setting Oswald back for the success which he deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed to me that another great impact Oswald has had on Disney was the lessons learned. Since then, the studio has been fiercely protective of its intellectual property. There has been plenty of news online involving recent lawsuits brought by Disney concerning copyrights. In 2006, Oswald was repatriated back to Disney under a special deal. However, among the 26 cartoons created by Walt Disney, only 13 were found. Although the uncovered loss was unfortunate, I believe Disney now has the resource and opportunity to make Oswald a great character that no one will ever be able to take away anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all had our favorite characters when we were little, which included some cartoon characters most of the time. The animation created by Walt Disney studio has changed so drastically over the decades, and Mickey still remains one of the most important figures in the history of American animation. Yet, there would be no Mickey without Oswald. Even when today most of Disney’s newest movies do not feature its first characters, neither Mickey nor Oswald should be forgotten. A journey to discover some of the lost gems can be really exciting, even though it may require some delicate process of restoring them. Eventually, we will be able to remember once again the laughter and happiness these cartoon characters had brought into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[“La primavera” (Spring)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi has been one of my favorite composed works of all time.

&lt;p&gt;Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi has been one of my favorite composed works of all time. As a violinist himself, Antonio Vivaldi has always been one of my most admired musicians and composers. Since I started playing the violin 6, I have played lots of violin pieces written by him. In high school, my friends and I formed a chamber ensemble group, and we chose to play Concerto No.1 in E Major “Spring” for our first performance. We ended up performing it multiple times at my school’s Christmas Eve show (I went to high school in China), New Year Gala, and a charity show. That was definitely my best memory in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to describe Four Seasons to someone who has never heard it before, I would just use the form of storytelling. Vivaldi wrote a short poem for each movement of each concerto in Four Seasons. When listening to the first movement I noticed the following story: in the beginning, the movement of spring advanced with the birds’ joyful greeting in delightful songs. Suddenly, a thunderstorm came and the wind blew violently. Lighting and thunder then heralded the storm, shrouding the air with a black cloak. After the storm recedes, the birds return to their joyful singing again. The first movement is really cohesive and consistent with the joy of spring in my mind. With just a little imagination, the listeners will be able to hear the sound of birds chirping, the brooks murmuring, and the rain falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of concepts and vocabulary from class relevant to Four Seasons. The texture of each concerto varies and resembles its respective season. For each season, there are three parts, and Vivaldi used the fast-slow-fast tempo organization for each part. This first movement in Spring an Allegro, meaning that it should be performed fast and joyfully. In addition, the first movement is written in ritornello(return) form. The ritornello appeared five times in the first movement, and the ensemble and the soloist return to it in different keys and harmonies, which really establishes the unifying theme of “Spring”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people may not be familiar with musical terms, I feel like the above characteristics of Four Seasons are still easily detectable. Listeners can still get a close-enough sense of the music just by listening. Even if I have not performed this piece, I would still love it just for how beautiful it sounds. The first movement is so energizing, joyful, and vivid, exactly like my feelings for spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think listeners can benefit by both actively and passively listening to this piece. Four Seasons has been played so prevalently in soundtracks and public places today, which proves its beauty and timeless popularity. Yet every time I listened to this piece passively, I ended up finding myself engaged and internalizing the expressions.
